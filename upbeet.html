            <h1>Up Beet / </h1><h2>info 360 final group project</h2>
            <p class="work-type">Mobile App Design</p>
            <p><strong>Winter 2017</strong>. This final project involved creating a mobile application that solved some sort of user need or want. Our target audience included grocery shoppers who wanted to get the best deals and savings during their weekly grocery trips. Before designing, we gathered information through interviews that most shoppers prefer to just visit grocery stores that are the most convenient for them without checking prices via the weekly paper ad as itâ€™s too time consuming.</p>
            <p>The solution for the problem we identified is a mobile application called <strong>Up Beet</strong> that will help grocery shoppers find the best sales and deals for the current week. Our design pursues to solve the problem we identified by creating a convenient way to browse weekly ads through the use of a smartphone application. Having the ability for users to easily compare prices between different stores at their fingertips would allow the shopper to increase their weekly savings by maximizing time, money, and convenience.</p>
            <p>We designed prototypes of our initial design on paper and eventually designed hi-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD based on feedback from multiple usability studies. We then prototyped all of our completed wireframes to really give users a feel of how the application would perform if it was actually fully developed.</p>
            <p>Our final application design, Up Beet, gives users the ability to compare prices between stores easily to maximize their weekly savings and time.</p>
