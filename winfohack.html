            <h1>IMPACKt / </h1><h2>winfo hackathon</h2>
            <p class="work-type">Mobile App Design</p>
            <p><strong>Winter 2018</strong>. During the WINFO hackathon, my team designed a mobile application that could make an impact in a reach for equality. Over the course of 12 hours, we brainstormed ideas of what we could design and designed a working prototype of our idea.</p>
            <p>Our idea centered around an application named IMPACKt. Upon signup, a user would select the values that mean the most to them (such as diversity, women’s rights, etc.). This application would then allow users to browse companies that they shop at to see the kind of values that they have and see if those values match their own. We also designed the functionality of being able to take a photo of the logo of a company to allow easy access to the company’s profile within the application.</p>
            <p>With this knowledge at hand, the user would be able to make informed choices on whether or not they should continue to shop somewhere or if they should put their money elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Throughout the entire hackathon, I focused on designing the signin/signup pages, the home page that displays recent articles about companies you follow, and the camera. Additionally, I provided input and critiques to the rest of my team and helped them design their own screens.</p>
