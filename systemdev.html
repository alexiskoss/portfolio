            <h1>System Development Life Cycle for UWMC / </h1><h2>info 380 final project</h2>
            <p class="work-type">Design</p>
            <p><strong>Spring 2017</strong>. In this group project, we were tasked with redesigning the evaluation system currently in place at the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). We created a 41 page document that covers all stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) in an effort to plan, describe, analyze, and recommend an implementation strategy for our proposed solution. Our goal was to digitize and automate an archaic paper-based system by implementing a web interface that allows easy initiation and tracking of evaluations.</p>
            <p>Throughout our evaluation, we outlined the current state that included an overview and risk analysis of the current system with recommended next steps while our proposed future state included new requirements, to-be use cases and process flows, new recommendations, and a future state risk assessment along with our proposed strategy to implement the new system.</p>
            <p>I was also responsible for designing the user flow diagrams and for designing what the actual evaluation system would look like. I, along with one other person, designed the sort of graphs we would like Madeline to see so she could stay on top of her evaluations while also allowing her to easily send evaluations to the respective providers that could quickly be filled out online, with no paper.</p>
