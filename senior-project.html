            <h1>HS Senior Project / </h1><h2>high school culmination project</h2>
            <p class="work-type">CSS, HTML & JavaScript</p>
            <p><strong>June, 2014</strong>. For my senior project in high school, I decided to explore the career of being a "web developer," so for the culmination of my research, I coded a potential website design that a business could use. </p>
            <p>My first task was to design this website. With very little experience with website design, I had to research a lot on all of the important heuristics of design before I started creating my mock ups. </p>
            <p>Additionally, at the time, my coding knowledge was limited to the CSS and HTML that I taught myself over the years. I used a framework for the initial base of my website so by exploring it, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive web design and exactly what that meant. I had to code for all different sizes of resolutions and think about how each element on the page would have to look and respond to those changes. I also implemented some Javascript that I found that fit what I envisioned for the image carousel because at that time, I had very little experience with Javascript. </p>
            <p>By the end of this process, I learned a tremendous amount about coding and design. I learned what makes a good design... and a not so great one. By applying those principles, I was able to code what I designed by looking up tutorials as I needed them.</p>
