            <h1>SHIFT / </h1><h2>info 365 final project</h2>
            <p class="work-type">Mobile OS Design</p>
            <p><strong>Autumn 2017</strong>. This group project involved our team designing a new mobile operating system design that fits the needs of our target audience of working professionals. Our mobile OS is named Shift because the OS shifts with the time of day and is highly integrated with the weather, alerting working professionals if the weather will alter their plans. Colors gradually shift from morning to night, with the accent colors in the apps changing based on time along with light and dark themes to match respectively. Shifting colors allows the target audience to quickly know the time.</p>
            <p>I was personally responsible for designing the calendar, weather, and camera applications as well as the lock screen. Near the end of our project, I also helped make all of our applications cohesive with each other by going through and editing margins, colors, and design choices to ensure that all of our applications felt like they belonged to one operating system.</p>
            <p>Our completed project not only includes a newly designed OS, but also includes a suite of 15 applications.</p>
