# Portfolio
A portfolio that showcases all of my design and coding work while in school at the University of Washington. 

## Design & Tools 
I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to design create my website. By using small sections to separate the different areas of my portfolio, users can quickly find the information that they're looking for. Whether it's some of my recent work or more information about me, the information can be quickly accessed via the navigation bar. 

## Important Information
