            <h1>Bandit / </h1><h2>INFO 343 final group project</h2>
            <p class="work-type">JavaScript, React, Firebase, CSS & HTML</p>
            <p><strong>Autumn 2016</strong>. The goal was to create a website that incorporated the various things we learned over the quarter (React, Javascript, and Firebase in particular). We decided to create a website, called Bandit, where bands, various types of musicians, and even producers could connect to find gigs, start new bands, or mix the next hit album. Our goal was to create a website that satisfied the four user stories that we identified in our proposal.</p>
            <p>I, along with one team member, set up our git hub repository that stored all of our work and allowed us to work in a collaborative setting. I also had a part in deciding the overall layout design of Bandit and the color scheme we used. </p>
            <p>I was solely responsible for the sign up, sign in, and sign out scripts as well as the profile pages and recent listings. Everything I coded was built using React so each of us could keep our components separate until all parts were completed. </p>
            <p>For the login system, I used firebase to store the users in the database for quick and easy manipulation. I coded the scripts using Javascript and all fields error check for correct, valid input. </p>
            <p>I was also responsible for coding and designing the user profile pages. Each user has their own unique and individual profile page that gives each user their respective editing capabilities via Javascript. They can upload a photo for their profile image or cover photo and can edit any personal information (ranging from location to music genre to an about me). All of this information is stored in firebase.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I also coded the recent listings function on the profile and the recent listings page that is accessed via the board. With Javascript, I was able to pull a user’s three most recent listings to display on their profile page and then provide a user’s ten most recent listings via the link accessed from the board.</p>
