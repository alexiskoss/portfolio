            <h1>Charrette / </h1><h2>HCDE Directed Research Group</h2>
            <p class="work-type">Design</p>
            <p><strong>Autumn 2016</strong>. As part of a directed research group in the Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering (HCDE) department, I was part of a group with two other students with a goal of redesigning the standard charette process to be more applicable to students outside of a college setting. I was responsible for leading, designing, and executing a new protocol for the charette process that considered the unique dynamics and time limitations of the classrooms we chose to visit. </p>

            <p>We executed our protocol with two groups of 30 students at Roosevelt High School, guiding them through the multiple design sprints we included in our protocol that would help each group design a smart vehicle that met the needs of their chosen user group. Afterwards, we reflected on our protocol and listed the things that could be changed, based on our observations, to make our new charrette protocol applicable to schools across Washington state to help promote awareness of HCDE and other related engineering majors.</p>
